Installing Linux

Anticipatable problems:

Multi-Boot installation : Linux not loading.
(some) HP laptops with UEFI Settings:
    UEFI settings will not allow you to boot Linux.
    Quick fix: Press F9 to go to boot manager and switch to Linux.

Other laptops:
    Suggestion 1:
        Enable Legacy Support while booting and give Legacy support first preference. Switch between Legacy and UEFI boots to switch between OS.
For windows users:
    Disable quickstart

**There might be an elegant way. I am listing some harmless ways**

Virtual box installation:
    VT-x is not available/disabled.
    Fix: Start BIOS and enable Virtualization in the BIOS.
    
Method 1: Multi-boot installation
* Have atleast one "Empty" Drive of sufficient space
* Download an iso image of the linux distro 
* Take a USB drive CD/DVD and "burn" the iso into the drive to make it a bootable device.
* Go to bios and give preference to bootable device over system Hard Disk Drive.
* Plug the pendrive or mount the CD/DVD and switch on PC.
* Linux bootloader will start up
* Continue to General steps

Method 2: Installing via Virtual box
* Download an iso image of the linux distro
* Download and install virtual box.
* Create a virtual machine with a hard disk, RAM and processors.
* Mount the iso image in the virtual machine's optical drive.
* Start the machine; Linux bootloader will start up
* Continue to General steps

General Steps:
* Decide if you want to download updates and software from internet while installation.
* "Delete" the free drive and make it a free space partition.
* From the free space, create a swap space (size = equal to system RAM) and a Directory called "/" with ext4 journaling file system.
* [Optional] Create other directories if you want
* [Important] Review all info about the partition table before finalizing the partition table changes.
* Set the username, password, computer name, time zone, keyboard layout and a few other basic settings
* [Important] Review all info and installation
* Sit back and wait till installation.
* [IMPORTANT] DO NOT POWER-OFF OR UNPLUG THE CD/DVD/USB DURING THE INSTALLATION
* When ready, shut down and remove the mountable device.
* Startup and choose between the installed OS and launch and go on!
