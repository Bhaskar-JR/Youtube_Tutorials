## To do

1. install python using anaconda
2. install a known package
3. install a channel package
4. install a bz2 file
5. Bulk install bz2 files
6. create an environment
7. install package in an environment
8. softlink an environment to use it concurrently with the default python

# added by Anaconda3 4.1.1 installer
export PATH="/home/arun/anaconda3/bin:$PATH"

# Manually added to use Anaconda Python 2.7
# sudo ln -s /home/arun/anaconda3/envs/py27env/bin/python /usr/bin/py27on
# The above symbolic link is added and it is successful


Problems with PIP installer
* Dependency check
    may not show the required packages
    Can install them without the dependencies, only to throw error afterwards
* Maintaining multiple environments is difficult
* Messes up with system python
    package upgrade/update/downgrade/uninstall in system python can upset other programs

Advantages of Anaconda installer
* Lists all dependencies
    can swap between package versions easily
    installs dependencies while installing packages
* Easy swap between environment
    maintaining environments is easy
* Does not affect system python!
    So, system software remains undisturbed
