Distro Tour Disclaimers and Heads ups!

* This is not a full review! rather, it is a brief tour about the distro
    > Hence, I might have left some features unexplained knowingly or unknowingly.
    > However, if there is a special feature that I did not mention, 
      let me know!

* The distro tours are for "getting a feel and idea" about the distro.
    > So, I might not be going too technical.
    > These videos are meant to "throw some light" for people who are entering
      linux and/or want to know about the linux distros in general.
    > As a result, do not form a strong opinion based on the tours. Do follow it
      up with your own research by hearing from other sources authentic.
    
* The distros choose to tour on are based on my interests.
    > Hence, if i hear a lot of interesting info about a particular distro, 
      or, if i find some distros interesting on my own research, then I might
      give you all a tour on.
    > If you have any specific Linux Distro that you want me to look at, then
      add them as a comment in the video description. I might look at it in the future.

* All my comments and the critics about the distros are purely my views based on
  my experience, learning and research.
    > So, there is a chance that you might disagree on certain aspects or 
      details I might mention. 
    > While I totally agree that differences of opinion are possible, if you 
      have any, you can post it as a comment in a polite manner.

* I (usually) run the distros in virtualbox and hence the performance might vary
  significantly sometimes and very little sometimes against running in actual
  hardware. (And sometimes, I might run them in actual hardware)
    > Also, sometimes certain bugs and issues might pop-up because of the virtualbox
      and might not pop-up because of the virtualbox!
    > Also, the performance might/can vary based on the hardware.

* There is no perfect linux distro or linux desktop!
    > Each Linux Distro and Desktop has their own target audience, pros and cons,
      purpose for it's existence etc.,
    > So, you are welcome to experiment with the distros and pick the one that 
      suits your needs and requirements.

* I will do my best to provide you the information as factually accurate as possible.
    > If suppose there is a mistake or I am wrong, let me know.

* Sometimes, installing distros in hardware can be problematic.
    > So, have the instructions closeby and TAKE A BACKUP OF YOUR DATA FOR SAFETY!
