Which Distro should I choose? (my opinions)
    For starters:
        Desktop based. (Preferrably Debian Family)
        - Help you kick start with many software already existing or easy to install
        - Not required to know the system deeper
        - Most aesthetic customization, least software customization
    Intermediate users:
        (my suggestions) Redhat, Fedora, CentOS
        - Not all software might be available, may need to compile, build and install some.
        - Need to know the system a bit deeper
        - intermediate aesthetic customization, intermediate software customization
    Hard core users:
        Arch, Debian, Slackware, Gentoo
        - You have the core software only, others have to be installed or built manually
        - Need to know the system much more deeper
        - Least aesthetic customization, Most software customization
        
    General Considerations:
        - Availability of Software user requires
        - Degree of User preferred customization (aesthetic and software)
        - Motive behind the original distros' existence
        - Point version or Rolling Version

What is a Rolling version Distro?
    - No specific OS version. OS gets updated every now and then.
    - Only certain snapshots(reference versions) are called OS versions
    - One gets the bleeding-edge (most updated and recent) software
    eg: Arch, Gentoo
    
What is a Point version Distro?
    - Specific versions, with some limited software, OS updates
    - Usually stable,
    - Bleeding edge available only in the next version
    - Have to install from scratch or upgrade entire OS every now and then
    eg: Fedora, Ubuntu, etc.,

What is a package manager?
    Software to install, remove, build, compile, update, upgrade software packages and even OS kernels
    eg: apt, yast, yum, aptitude, dnf, synaptic, aur, pamac, octopi, yaourt

Why there are so many package managers?
    Development method, internal architecture being different for different linux kernels.
    
What is a linux desktop?
    The GUI software for the OS.
    eg: Unity, Gnome, KDE, Budgie, XFCE, Pantheon, Deepin, LXQT, Mate, cinnamon, Enlightenment, etc.,
    
What is the difference between desktop?
    - Shortcuts
    - Customization
    - Resource usage
    - Hardware capacity
    - look and feel
    - Features
    - Software bundles

What desktop should I choose?
    - Refer above question,
    - 
    .................
    - Stability,
    - Development progress, direction
