Files and Purposes
==================

*.h 				header files
*.c					C files
*.o					object files
*.out, *.x, *.exe	executable files


Header files:
	Have global constants
	Function declarations
	preprocessor directives

C files:
	Where we write the main program
	Write set of functions

Object files:
	Have the C files translated and compiled into machine language
	Needed to make executable

Executable files:
	Has the final application that runs the instructions specified
	
#include --- Preprocessor directive - tells C compiler to include definitions
			 of functions in the specified "filename.c"

Eg:
	printf function definition is written in some file namely stdio.c
		and an object file named stdio.o is available in the system
	declarations of functions in stdio.c are in stdio.h
	So, including stdio.h tells the compiler to include stdio.o file!

Notes for Future:
=================	
* C files without "main function" need custom-made header files.
* Once the above C files are created and an object file is made, use header files
	to include the functions of such C files into other programs
* Once Object files are made, C files are not needed!!!! Header files and Object
	files are sufficient in the future.
